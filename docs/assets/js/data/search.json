    "content": "IntroThe printer used for the project is a refurbished Ender 3 model, which has undergone extensive modifications aimed at enhancing both print speed and quality. Additionally, it operates on an open-source operating system called Klipper, facilitating ease of further customization and modification.Modifications SectionHardwareBelow is a list of the hardware modifications that the printer has undergone.  Bed Distance Sensor  SKR Mini E3 V3 Motherboard  Dual Z axis  Direct Drive Orbiter V2.0 Extruder  Custom Hotend Cooling  CHT nozzle  Slimmer PSU  PTFE Bowden Tube BDsensor  Description  BD sensor is the first distance sensor that can work with 3D printer and do fast bed leveling and adjust z axis in real time.   Part List  The parts required were a BDsensor (bought here https://www.pandapi3d.com/bdsensor) and the modified portion of the custom hotend cooling  Instructions  I followed along with this video, which provides a comprehensive guide. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDOYYskbxV8  Summary of Guide  The video introduces the BD bed distance sensor by Discovery Sky, highlighting its features and installation for 3D printers with Klipper firmware. It covers auto bed leveling, the sensor’s inductive style for improved usability, and necessary wiring and pin configurations. Step-by-step instructions for installation and firmware updates are provided, along with calibration procedures to ensure accurate measurements. The sensor’s quick scanning capabilities are demonstrated, concluding with a print job test to verify first layer adherence and overall calibration effectiveness.  Note that the cable connecting to the black magnetic core coil is somewhat fragile and can snap off it turned or twisted too much.  Results  The results are the BDsensor are a before and after of using a different bedleveling hardware call a bltouch.SKR Mini E3 V3 MotherboardOrdered list  Firstly  Secondly  ThirdlyUnordered list  Chapter          Section                  Paragraph                    ToDo list  Job          Step 1      Step 2      Step 3      Description list  Sun  the star around which the earth orbits  Moon  the natural satellite of the earth, visible by reflected light from the sunBlock Quote  This line shows the block quote.Prompts  An example showing the tip type prompt.
