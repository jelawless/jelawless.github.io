## BDsensor 

Description
: BD sensor is the first distance sensor that can work with 3D printer and do fast bed leveling and adjust z axis in real time. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/bd-sensor-kit-.jpg){: width="300" height="250" .w-50 .right}


Part List
: The parts required were a BDsensor (bought here <https://www.pandapi3d.com/bdsensor>) and the modified portion of the custom hotend cooling  


Instructions
: Here was the video that I following along with, it is very thorough <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDOYYskbxV8>

> Note that the cable connecting to the black magnetic core coil is somewhat fragile and can snap off it turned or twisted too much.

Results
: The results are the BDsensor are a before and after of using a different bedleveling hardware call a bltouch.

## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
  \label{eq:series}
\end{equation}
$$

We can reference the equation as \eqref{eq:series}.

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
