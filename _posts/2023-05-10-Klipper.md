## Klipper Host (Raspberry Pi 3B+)

Description
: The Raspberry Pi 3B+ serves as the dedicated host computer running the Klipper firmware. Klipper utilizes a dual-microcontroller architecture where the main computation (processing G-code, running advanced algorithms like Input Shaping) is offloaded from the 3D printer's mainboard (SKR Mini) to the powerful Raspberry Pi. This enables the high-speed, high-precision performance the modified Ender 3 is capable of. It also hosts the web interface (Mainsail/Fluidd) for remote control and monitoring. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/RaspberryPi.webp){: width="350" .w-50 .right}

Part List
: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, SD Card (32GB+), Power Supply (5V, 2.5A minimum), and a case.

Klipper Configuration
: Involves flashing a pre-configured OS (like MainsailOS or FluiddPi) onto the SD card. The Pi then communicates with the SKR Mini E3 V3 via a USB cable, where the Klipper service is run and manages the entire print process using the customized `printer.cfg` file.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note: Using the Raspberry Pi 3B+ provides sufficient processing power for Klipper's demands, especially for running Input Shaping and Pressure Advance. Ensuring the power supply is stable and adequate (2.5A or higher) is critical for preventing undervoltage issues during computationally intensive operations.
{: .prompt-info }

Results
: Enables the core functionality of the entire project: fast, precise, and remotely controllable 3D printing. It dramatically reduces motion system artifacts, allows for real-time monitoring and tuning via a web interface, and provides the necessary processing headroom for pushing print speeds well beyond the stock printer's capabilities.

## BDsensor 

Description
: BD sensor is the first distance sensor that can work with 3D printer and do fast bed leveling and adjust z axis in real time. Integration required careful adherence to the wiring and pin configuration guide found at: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDOYYskbxV8> ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/bd-sensor-kit.jpg){: width="300" height="250" .w-50 .right}

Part List
: The parts required were a BDsensor (bought here <https://www.pandapi3d.com/bdsensor>) and the modified portion of the custom hotend cooling  

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note that the cable connecting to the black magnetic core coil is somewhat fragile and can snap off it turned or twisted too much.
{: .prompt-danger }
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Results
: The results are the BDsensor are a before and after of using a different bedleveling hardware call a bltouch. 

## SKR Mini E3 V3 Motherboard

Description
: The SKR Mini E3 V3 is a popular drop-in replacement mainboard for the Ender 3. It features a more powerful 32-bit processor (STM32G0B1RET6) and integrated TMC2209 silent stepper drivers. This upgrade significantly reduces motor noise and provides more processing power, which is beneficial for running Klipper firmware smoothly and handling complex calculations for high-speed printing. Installation required careful wiring of existing components to the new board's specific pinouts. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/SKRMINIV3.jpg){: width="300" .w-50 .right} 

Part List
: BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V3 Motherboard (<https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3-v2-0-32-bit-control-board-for-ender-3>)

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note (Troubleshooting): I've found that occasionally after updating the Klipper software on the Raspberry Pi host, the BDsensor will fail to initialize. The required fix is to manually recompile and re-flash the `.bin` firmware file onto the SKR Mini E3 V3 board to restore full sensor functionality.
{: .prompt-warning }

Results
: This upgrade leads to noticeably quieter printer operation due to the TMC2209 drivers. The 32-bit processor allows Klipper to run more efficiently, potentially enabling higher microstepping, faster processing of G-code, and smoother execution of features like Input Shaping and Pressure Advance, contributing to both speed and quality improvements.

## Dual Z axis

Description
: This modification adds a second Z-axis lead screw and stepper motor to the Ender 3, mirroring the existing one on the other side of the X-gantry. The primary goal is to improve Z-axis stability and prevent gantry sag, especially on the side opposite the original lead screw. This was a critical step to support the weight of the heavier direct drive extruder. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/DualZ.jpg){: width="300" .w-50 .right} 

Part List
: Dual Z-axis upgrade kit, typically including a lead screw, stepper motor, mounting brackets, coupler, and wiring harness. (Example kit: <https://www.amazon.com/Official-Creality-Upgrade-Stepper-3D/dp/B09N8QQDSP>)

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note: Proper gantry alignment (tramming) after installation is critical to prevent Z-binding and ensure smooth vertical movement. Klipper configuration adjustments were necessary to define the second Z-stepper as a mirror of the primary motor.
{: .prompt-warning }

Results
: The dual Z-axis setup significantly improves the stability of the X-gantry, leading to more consistent layer heights across the entire width of the print bed. This reduces artifacts related to gantry sag and potential binding, contributing to better overall print quality, especially on taller prints or those requiring precise Z-movement.

## Direct Drive Orbiter V2.0 Extruder

Description
: The Orbiter V2.0 is a lightweight, compact, and high-performance direct drive extruder. Replacing the stock Bowden setup, it mounts the extruder motor directly on the hotend assembly. This drastically shortens the filament path, providing much more precise control over extrusion and retraction. The Orbiter's geared design (7.5:1 ratio) offers high torque in a small package. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/Orbiter-v2.gif){: width="450" .w-50 .right} 

Part List
: Orbiter V2.0 Extruder (<https://www.orbiterprojects.com/orbiter-v2-0/>). May require a specific 3D printed mount to attach to the Ender 3's X-carriage and hotend (potentially integrated with the custom cooling duct).

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note: Implementing this change required careful Klipper configuration. The Orbiter's specific `rotation_distance` was sourced from the official documentation, and the retraction settings were drastically reduced (I now run between 0.5mm - 1.5mm). Tuning Pressure Advance after installation was absolutely critical to maximize the print quality at higher speeds. I followed the firmware configuration details on the official Orbiter project page: <https://www.orbiterprojects.com/orbiter-v2-0/>
{: .prompt-info }

Results
: Direct drive, especially with a capable extruder like the Orbiter V2.0, dramatically improves retraction performance, reducing stringing and oozing. It enables reliable printing of flexible filaments (like TPU) and allows for potentially faster printing speeds due to quicker and more accurate extrusion control, directly impacting print quality and speed capabilities.

## Custom Hotend Cooling (Apollolander Dual 5015)

Description
: This is a custom-designed, 3D-printed hotend shroud (Apollolander model) specifically adapted for the Ender 3's stock hotend. It utilizes two powerful 5015 radial (blower) fans for part cooling, offering significantly increased airflow compared to the single, smaller stock fan. The shroud was printed in PETG for heat resistance. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/Hotend.jpg){: width="300" .w-50 .right} 

Part List
: 3D Printed Parts for the Apollolander shroud (<https://www.printables.com/model/544890-apollolander-stock-hotend-dual-5015>), two 5015 blower fans (24V), appropriate screws (likely M3), and wiring.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note: Ensure the 5015 fans are the correct voltage (24V for Ender 3). The increased airflow is substantial; you may need to run the fans at lower percentages (e.g., 30-70%) for materials like PETG or ABS to prevent warping or layer adhesion issues.
{: .prompt-warning }

Results
: The vastly improved part cooling allows for much faster printing speeds, especially when dealing with overhangs and bridges, which solidify more quickly. This leads to cleaner prints, sharper details, and enables pushing the printer's speed limits further, particularly with PLA filament.

## CHT nozzle

Description
: The Bondtech CHT (Core Heating Technology) nozzle is a specialized nozzle designed to increase the melting rate of filament. It features a unique internal geometry that splits the filament into multiple strands just before exiting, significantly increasing the surface area in contact with the heated nozzle walls. This allows the filament to absorb heat much faster. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/CHTNozzle.jpg){: width="375" .w-50 .right} 

Part List
: Bondtech CHT Coated Brass Nozzle (ensure correct size, e.g., 0.4mm, and thread type, MK8 for Ender 3) (<https://www.bondtech.se/product/bondtech-cht-coated-brass-nozzle/>)

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note: This nozzle's melting efficiency is very high. Through testing, I've found that CHT clones available on sites like AliExpress can actually achieve very similar performance results to the original Bondtech, making them a viable, cost-effective alternative for volumetric flow improvements. Retuning print profiles (speed, potentially temperature) is highly recommended.
{: .prompt-info }

Results
: The primary result is a substantial increase in the maximum volumetric flow rate the hotend can sustain. This directly translates to the ability to print much faster without the print quality degrading due to the hotend's inability to melt plastic quickly enough. It's a key modification for maximizing print speed.

## Slimmer PSU (Meanwell)

Description
: This modification replaces the stock Ender 3 power supply unit (PSU) with a slimmer, typically higher-quality Meanwell model (often the LRS-350-24). Besides freeing up vertical space beneath the printer, Meanwell PSUs are generally known for their reliability, efficiency, and stable power output compared to some stock units. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/Meanwell.jpg){: width="300" .w-50 .right} 

Part List
: Meanwell LRS-350-24 Power Supply (or similar 24V model) (<https://creality3dofficial.com/products/meanwell-switching-enclosed-power-supply>), potentially 3D printed mounting brackets if relocating the PSU.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> **DANGER**: When my unit arrived, the voltage selector switch was set to the 240V position. It is critical to ensure you move this switch to the **120V** setting if you are operating in the US or any other region using 120V mains power. Always confirm the power is off before touching any internal wiring.
{: .prompt-danger }

Results
: Provides more clearance under the printer, useful for custom enclosures or component placement. Offers potentially more stable and reliable power delivery to the mainboard and other components, which can contribute to overall system stability, especially during demanding high-speed prints. It's often considered a reliability and safety upgrade.

## PTFE Bowden Tube (Capricorn)

Description
: This refers to upgrading the stock white PTFE tube with a higher-quality one, such as the blue Capricorn tubing. In a Bowden setup, this reduces filament slop and improves retraction. However, for this project, the tube was used solely to manage the short path to the direct drive extruder. ![Desktop View](/pictures/klipper/Capricorn.jpg){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: Capricorn PTFE tubing (<https://store.creality.com/products/capricorn-teflon-tube-and-pneumatic-connector-package>), potentially upgraded pneumatic couplers for better tube grip.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

> Note: With the Orbiter V2.0 Direct Drive extruder installed, the long Bowden tube is no longer needed. A very short segment of this Capricorn tubing was used as a filament guide before the extruder, which works perfectly.
