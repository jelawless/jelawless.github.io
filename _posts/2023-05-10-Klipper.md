## SKR Mini E3 V3 Motherboard

Description
: The SKR Mini E3 V3 is a popular drop-in replacement mainboard for the Ender 3. It features a more powerful 32-bit processor (STM32G0B1RET6) and integrated TMC2209 silent stepper drivers. This upgrade significantly reduces motor noise and provides more processing power, which is beneficial for running Klipper firmware smoothly and handling complex calculations for high-speed printing. ![Desktop View](/pictures/UC/r.gif){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V3 Motherboard (<https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3-v2-0-32-bit-control-board-for-ender-3>)

Instructions
: Installation involves removing the original Creality board and connecting the existing wires (stepper motors, thermistors, endstops, fans, screen) to the corresponding ports on the SKR Mini E3 V3. Numerous online guides and videos specific to installing this board on an Ender 3 are available. Flashing Klipper firmware is required after installation.

Summary of Common Guides
: Guides typically cover opening the printer's electronics enclosure, disconnecting the old board, mounting the new SKR Mini E3 V3, reconnecting all components (paying close attention to pinouts), and finally compiling and flashing the Klipper firmware tailored to the new board's configuration.

> Note: Ensure correct wiring, especially for fans, as polarity matters. Double-check the Klipper `printer.cfg` file for the correct pin assignments specific to the V3 board.
{: .prompt-warning }

Results
: This upgrade leads to noticeably quieter printer operation due to the TMC2209 drivers. The 32-bit processor allows Klipper to run more efficiently, potentially enabling higher microstepping, faster processing of G-code, and smoother execution of features like Input Shaping and Pressure Advance, contributing to both speed and quality improvements.

## Dual Z axis

Description
: This modification adds a second Z-axis lead screw and stepper motor to the Ender 3, mirroring the existing one on the other side of the X-gantry. The primary goal is to improve Z-axis stability and prevent gantry sag, especially on the side opposite the original lead screw. This is particularly important when using heavier direct drive extruders or custom toolheads. ![Desktop View](/pictures/UC/r.gif){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: Dual Z-axis upgrade kit, typically including a lead screw, stepper motor, mounting brackets, coupler, and wiring harness. (Example kit: <https://www.amazon.com/Official-Creality-Upgrade-Stepper-3D/dp/B09N8QQDSP>)

Instructions
: Installation generally involves attaching the second stepper motor mount, installing the lead screw and nut, connecting the motor (often via a splitter cable to the original Z-port, or to a dedicated second Z-port if the mainboard supports it), and ensuring the X-gantry is level (trammed) after installation.

Summary of Common Guides
: Guides demonstrate the mechanical assembly of the second Z-axis components and the electrical connection. A crucial step emphasized is leveling the X-gantry relative to the printer frame after installation to ensure both lead screws move the gantry evenly.

> Note: Proper gantry alignment (tramming) after installation is critical to prevent Z-binding and ensure smooth vertical movement. Depending on the wiring method (splitter vs separate drivers), Klipper configuration adjustments might be needed (e.g., `[z_stepper_split]` or configuring `[stepper_z1]`).
{: .prompt-warning }

Results
: The dual Z-axis setup significantly improves the stability of the X-gantry, leading to more consistent layer heights across the entire width of the print bed. This reduces artifacts related to gantry sag and potential binding, contributing to better overall print quality, especially on taller prints or those requiring precise Z-movement.

## Direct Drive Orbiter V2.0 Extruder

Description
: The Orbiter V2.0 is a lightweight, compact, and high-performance direct drive extruder. Replacing the stock Bowden setup, it mounts the extruder motor directly on the hotend assembly. This drastically shortens the filament path, providing much more precise control over extrusion and retraction. The Orbiter's geared design (7.5:1 ratio) offers high torque in a small package. ![Desktop View](/pictures/UC/r.gif){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: Orbiter V2.0 Extruder (<https://www.orbiterprojects.com/orbiter-v2-0/>). May require a specific 3D printed mount to attach to the Ender 3's X-carriage and hotend (potentially integrated with the custom cooling duct).

Instructions
: Installation involves removing the old Bowden extruder and tube, printing and installing a suitable mount, attaching the Orbiter V2.0 to the mount, wiring the new stepper motor, and potentially modifying the hotend wiring. Significant Klipper configuration changes are required for extruder steps (`rotation_distance`), motor current, direction, and tuning Pressure Advance and retraction settings.

Summary of Common Guides
: Guides cover the mechanical mounting (often specific to the chosen printed adapter), wiring the LDO motor, and the essential Klipper configuration adjustments. Calibration steps for `rotation_distance`, retraction, and Pressure Advance are crucial for optimal performance.

> Note: This is a major change requiring careful Klipper configuration. The `rotation_distance` is critical and must be calibrated precisely. Retraction settings will need significant reduction compared to Bowden (typically 0.5mm - 1.5mm). Tuning Pressure Advance is highly recommended to maximize quality at speed.
{: .prompt-info }

Results
: Direct drive, especially with a capable extruder like the Orbiter V2.0, dramatically improves retraction performance, reducing stringing and oozing. It enables reliable printing of flexible filaments (like TPU) and allows for potentially faster printing speeds due to quicker and more accurate extrusion control, directly impacting print quality and speed capabilities.

## Custom Hotend Cooling (Apollolander Dual 5015)

Description
: This is a custom-designed, 3D-printed hotend shroud (Apollolander model) specifically adapted for the Ender 3's stock hotend (potentially modified for compatibility with other components like the Orbiter/BD Sensor). It utilizes two powerful 5015 radial (blower) fans for part cooling, offering significantly increased airflow compared to the single, smaller stock fan. ![Desktop View](/pictures/UC/r.gif){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: 3D Printed Parts for the Apollolander shroud (<https://www.printables.com/model/544890-apollolander-stock-hotend-dual-5015>), two 5015 blower fans (24V), appropriate screws (likely M3), and potentially wiring connectors or extensions.

Instructions
: Assembly involves printing the shroud components (PETG or ABS recommended for heat resistance), mounting the two 5015 fans onto the shroud, wiring the fans (typically in parallel) to the mainboard's part cooling fan port, and finally attaching the entire assembly to the hotend carriage.

Summary of Guide (from Printables page)
: The Printables page usually provides assembly instructions, a list of required non-printed hardware (fans, screws), printing recommendations (material, orientation, supports), and potentially wiring diagrams or notes.

> Note: Ensure the 5015 fans are the correct voltage (24V for Ender 3). The increased airflow is substantial; you may need to run the fans at lower percentages (e.g., 30-70%) for materials like PETG or ABS to prevent warping or layer adhesion issues. Check for compatibility or necessary modifications if using a non-stock hotend or extruder setup.
{: .prompt-warning }

Results
: The vastly improved part cooling allows for much faster printing speeds, especially when dealing with overhangs and bridges, which solidify more quickly. This leads to cleaner prints, sharper details, and enables pushing the printer's speed limits further, particularly with PLA filament.

## CHT nozzle

Description
: The Bondtech CHT (Core Heating Technology) nozzle is a specialized nozzle designed to increase the melting rate of filament. It features a unique internal geometry that splits the filament into multiple strands just before exiting, significantly increasing the surface area in contact with the heated nozzle walls. This allows the filament to absorb heat much faster. ![Desktop View](/pictures/UC/r.gif){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: Bondtech CHT Coated Brass Nozzle (ensure correct size, e.g., 0.4mm, and thread type, MK8 for Ender 3) (<https://www.bondtech.se/product/bondtech-cht-coated-brass-nozzle/>)

Instructions
: Installation is the same as replacing a standard nozzle. Heat the hotend to printing temperature (or slightly higher, e.g., 240-250Â°C), carefully unscrew the old nozzle using an appropriate wrench or socket while holding the heater block stationary with another wrench, and then screw in the CHT nozzle. Tighten it gently but firmly while hot to ensure a good seal against the heat break.

Summary of Standard Nozzle Change
: Heat hotend, use one tool to hold the heater block steady, use another tool to unscrew the old nozzle, screw in the new nozzle finger-tight, then give it a final tightening (approx. 1/4 turn) once fully heated. Avoid over-tightening.

> Note: Due to the increased melting efficiency, you might be able to use slightly lower printing temperatures for the same filament, or significantly increase print speeds before encountering under-extrusion (limited by volumetric flow). Retuning print profiles (speed, potentially temperature) is recommended to take full advantage of the higher flow rate.
{: .prompt-info }

Results
: The primary result is a substantial increase in the maximum volumetric flow rate the hotend can sustain. This directly translates to the ability to print much faster without the print quality degrading due to the hotend's inability to melt plastic quickly enough. It's a key modification for maximizing print speed.

## Slimmer PSU (Meanwell)

Description
: This modification replaces the stock Ender 3 power supply unit (PSU) with a slimmer, typically higher-quality Meanwell model (often the LRS-350-24). Besides freeing up vertical space beneath the printer, Meanwell PSUs are generally known for their reliability, efficiency, and stable power output compared to some stock units. ![Desktop View](/pictures/UC/r.gif){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: Meanwell LRS-350-24 Power Supply (or similar 24V model) (<https://creality3dofficial.com/products/meanwell-switching-enclosed-power-supply>), potentially 3D printed mounting brackets if relocating the PSU.

Instructions
: **This involves working with mains voltage and carries a risk of electric shock. Proceed with extreme caution and only if qualified.** It requires disconnecting AC power, opening the stock PSU enclosure, carefully disconnecting AC input and DC output wires, removing the old PSU, mounting the new Meanwell PSU, and correctly reconnecting the AC input (Live, Neutral, Ground) and DC output (+V, -V) wires to the screw terminals.

Summary of Common Guides
: Guides emphasize safety precautions, correctly identifying and connecting AC wires (L, N, E/GND) and DC wires (+, -), ensuring proper grounding, and securely mounting the new PSU. Often involves printing custom brackets for placement.

> **DANGER**: Working with mains voltage (AC Power) is extremely dangerous and can cause serious injury or death. Ensure the printer is completely unplugged from the wall before starting. If you are not comfortable and knowledgeable about mains wiring, do not attempt this modification. Double-check all connections before restoring power.
{: .prompt-danger }

Results
: Provides more clearance under the printer, useful for custom enclosures or component placement. Offers potentially more stable and reliable power delivery to the mainboard and other components, which can contribute to overall system stability, especially during demanding high-speed prints. It's often considered a reliability and safety upgrade.

## PTFE Bowden Tube (Capricorn)

Description
: This refers to upgrading the stock white PTFE tube with a higher-quality one, such as the blue Capricorn tubing. These tubes typically feature tighter internal diameter tolerances (e.g., 1.9mm vs 2.0mm) and higher temperature resistance. In a traditional Bowden setup, this reduces filament slop within the tube, leading to more responsive retractions and smoother filament feeding. ![Desktop View](/pictures/UC/r.gif){: width="300" .w-50 .right} <!-- Placeholder Image -->

Part List
: Capricorn PTFE tubing (<https://store.creality.com/products/capricorn-teflon-tube-and-pneumatic-connector-package>), potentially upgraded pneumatic couplers for better tube grip.

Instructions
: For a Bowden setup, installation involves removing the old tube by pressing down on the pneumatic couplers at both ends and pulling the tube out, cutting the new Capricorn tube to the correct length with a sharp, clean cut, and inserting it firmly back into the couplers. For a direct drive setup, its use is minimal, possibly just a very short segment inside the hotend or as a guide tube before the extruder.

Summary of Bowden Tube Replacement
: Depress coupler, remove old tube, ensure new tube has clean square cut ends, insert new tube fully into hotend coupler, re-secure clips (if used), insert other end into extruder coupler.

> Note: With the Orbiter V2.0 Direct Drive extruder installed, the long Bowden tube is eliminated. A small piece of PTFE tubing might still be used inside the hotend (between the extruder and the heat break) or as an external filament guide. In this direct drive context, the benefits of Capricorn tubing (tighter tolerance, improved retraction) are largely negated, though its higher temperature resistance might still be beneficial if a piece resides inside the hotend.
